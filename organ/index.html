        <p>This was my first major step into the world of audio electronics. About a year later, I began learning about
            synthesizers and constructing the basic circuits involved with them. After deciding to build one fully, I
        had the problem of deciding which kind I wanted to build, as there were several types.</p>
        <p>When I completed a design draft for the synthesizer of the complexity and versatility I wanted, I found that
        it would cost hundreds of dollars to construct. Considering the limited sound palette of any one synthesizer,
        I didn't feel it was worth the financial and time investment. Nevertheless, I decided to start step by step,
        doing everything in stages so if it becomes too expensive I can settle for a simpler instrument.</p>

            <figcaption>Top: The first step in the process; a keyboard, Bottom: the MIDI keyboard I bought later on</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I bought a old casio keyboard with missing keys from my music store to use as the base for the project and to
        control the electronics with. In the process of working with it, I managed to get the original keyboard
        electronics working again. The keyboard seemed to have a wide sound palette so I decided to play it for a while
        instead of stripping out the electronics. Working with the acoustic and orchestral emulations on the keyboard
        made me prefer them over the synthesized sounds; especially the organ. Over time, I became more partial to
        building something for samples, rather than a synthesizer, bringing to life the idea to build a virtual organ.</p>

    <p>Concept</p>
</div>
<div class="concept">
    <p>Instead of a synthesizer, I was going to build a virtual organ console, which meany lots of software. I wanted to
        use Ableton Live Lite which came with my launchpads. It had the capabilities for both samplers and synthesizers.</p>
    <p>The parts of an organ console I needed were two keyboards (or manuals), some expression (swell) pedals,
        a pedal-board, stop and piston buttons, a stool, a music stand and a sound system.</p>
    <h2>Pedalboard</h2>
    <p>After searching online; I realised that if I wanted a pedalboard and for less than $500 AUD, I would have to build my own.</p>
    <p>I went through several plans and designs but many were either weren't clear enough to build from or were beyond
        my woodworking skills. I found inspiration for a simple and cheap design from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skIXdKvqTZk">this link</a>.</p>
